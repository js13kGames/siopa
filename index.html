	<p>The lights flicker as you sit on a
		<entity>plaid couch<!--
			--><action off="pillow" turnon="pillow" show="pillow">Lift pillow</action><!--

	You look up and notice the

			<action off="television" turnon="television tornadoKnowledge" show="television">Turn on</action>
			<action on="television" turnoff="television" show="televisionOff">Turn off</action>
		</entity>
	directly across from you. The faded wallpaper behind it needs to be
	replaced. Rising, you notice the
		<entity>window
			<action show="lookWindow">Look out window</action>
			<action off="openWindow" turnon="openWindow" show="openWindow">Open window</action>
			<action on="openWindow" off="noWindow" turnon="noWindow" show="closeWindow">Close window</action>

	to your right. The
		<entity>front door
			<action show="lookDoor">Look out door</action>
			<action goto="porch" turnoff="inside" turnon="outside">Go out door</action>
		</entity>
	is beside the window and across from the door is the
		<entity>stairwell
			<action goto="landing">Climb up steps</action>
		</entity>
	and the coat closet.</p>

	<actionText name="pillow">
		You pick up the pillow. A feather pokes through the satin fabric and
		jabs your arm, but you cling to it as you carry it around the house
		with you.	
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="duckCouch">
		You lift several cushions off the couch and surround your body with
		them. In the soft comfort of your new fort, you place your hands on
		your neck and tuck your forehead against your knees.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="television">
		You press a button on the side of the television. The screen
		flickers to life. The local news broadcaster sits behind his desk. A
		weather map swirls behind him. As you peer closer, you hear the man
		say, "A tornado has just touched on the ground. Please take shelter
		immediately if you are…." The list of nearby towns includes yours.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="televisionOff">
		<p>As you press the power switch, the reporter’s voice is cut off
		mid-sentence. There is a loud pop and then a hum as the television
		shuts down.</p>
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="lookWindow">
		You look out the window. The sky is an eerie, blinding white-gray
		beyond the storm shelter. The storm shelter looks like an ancient
		anthill rising out of the carefully tailored lawn. Beyond the shelter,
		a grove of trees is swaying wildly in the wind.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="openWindow">
		Undoing the latch, you ease the windowpane open. Humid air floods
		inside and your neck grows sticky.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="closeWindow">
		Disliking the humid air, you attempt to close the window. The fierce
		wind wrenches the pane from your hand and sends it flying against the
		side of the house. The glass shatters, spraying shards across the
		porch.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="lookDoor">
		Cracking open the door, you look outside. On the porch you notice the
		rocking chair has tipped over.
	</actionText>
</scene>

<scene id="porch">
	<p>You step onto the porch. The
		<entity>rocking chair
			<action off="rockingChair" turnon="rockingChair" show="rockingChair">Pick up</action>
		</entity>
	rattles. Beyond the porch, you see the
		<entity>storm shelter<!--
			--><action show="lookShelter">Look inside</action><!--
			--><action goto="stormShelter" turnoff="outside" turnon="shelter">Go inside</action><!--
		--></entity><!--
	-->. It is an ugly mound of concrete and metal silhouetted against a pretty
	grove of trees.</p>

	<p>Behind you, the
		<entity>front door
			<action goto="livingRoom" turnoff="outside" turnon="inside">Go inside</action>
		</entity>
	remains open.</p>

	<actionText name="rockingChair">
		You reach for the armrest of the rocking chair and set it upright
		again. The wind forces it to scoot across the wooden floor. The rocking
		chair knocks against the banister, grating on your nerves.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="lookShelter">
		The door creaks as you twist the metal handle. It has been a long time
		since you oiled the hinges. You glance down the steps. Dank air hits
		you as you peer down into the small, dark space.
	</actionText>
</scene>

<scene id="stormShelter">
	<p>You quickly run down the steps. A collection of water bottles are gathered
	in one corner. They are covered in grime. You glance back up at the stairs
	as a sliver of gray sky pokes around the seams. Sighing, you realize the
		<entity>shelter door
			<action show="closeShelterDoor">Close door</action>
			<action goto="porch" turnoff="shelter" turnon="shelter">Exit shelter</action>
		</entity>
	did not quite shut behind you.</p>

	<actionText name="closeShelterDoor">
		<p>Hurrying back up the stairs, you grab the handle and attempt to
		force the door shut. It resists you as powerful gusts beat against the
		frame.</p>
	</actionText>
</scene>

<scene id="landing">
	<p>Arriving on the
		<entity>landing<!--
			--><action goto="livingRoom">Go downstairs</action><!--
		--></entity><!--
	-->, you are now on the second floor. There are two
	rooms with open doors. One is the
		<entity>bedroom
			<action goto="bedroom">Enter bedroom</action>
		</entity>
	and the other is an
		<entity goto="office">office<!--
			--><action goto="office">Enter office</action><!--

	-->.</p>
</scene>

<scene id="bedroom">
	<p>You look around the bedroom. A poster of your favorite movie hangs on
	the wall above your unmade
		<entity>bed<!--
			--><action off="makeBed" turnon="makeBed" show="makeBed">Make bed</action><!--
			--><action show="aroundBed">Move around bed</action><!--
		--></entity><!--
	-->. One corner of the poster is curling. Part
	of your navy and tan comforter curls on the floor at the foot of the bed.
	The far wall has a
		<entity>window
			<action off="openBlinds" turnon="openBlinds" show="openBlinds">Open blinds</action>
			<action on="openBlinds" turnon="tornadoKnowledge" show="lookWindow">Look out window</action>
		</entity>
	and the closet opens up beside it.</p>

	<actionText name="makeBed">
		Sighing, you stoop down and lift the comforter off the floor. Moving
		gingerly around the bed, you attempt not to scuff your shins against
		the footboard. You straighten the sheets, put the comforter back into
		place, and fluff the pillows.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="aroundBed">
		You scoot around the foot of the bed, careful not to ram your shin into
		the sharp corner of the bed frame. You have done that before and know
		it leaves a terrible bruise.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="openBlinds">
		Catching the nearby pole, you twist the blinds open. You tug the string
		to raise the blinds. Gray light floods the room.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="lookWindow">
		A strange shape moves beyond the grove of trees outside. It is
		top-heavy and sounds like a train bowling over everything in its path.
		Your heart begins to thunder in your chest. It is a tornado.
	</actionText>
</scene>

<scene id="office">
	<p>The
		<entity>light switch
			<action off="officeLight" turnon="officeLight" show="turnon">Turn on</action>
			<action on="officeLight" turnoff="officeLight" show="turnoff">Turn off</action>
		</entity>
	is awkwardly placed behind the office door. Since you
	can never see when you enter that room, you always are careful to keep the
	entrance clear of clutter.</p>

	<actionText name="turnon">
		The electric bulb pops and light fills the room.
	</actionText>
	
	<actionText name="turnoff">
		You turn off the light and scoot carefully around the open door.
	</actionText>

	<require on="officeLight">
		<p>You noticed your
			<entity>desk
				<action show="papers">Look at papers</action>
				<action show="drawer">Open drawer</action>

			<entity>recliner
				<action off="reclinerSit" turnon="reclinerSit" show="reclinerSit">Sit down</action>
				<action on="reclinerSit" turnooff="reclinerSit" show="reclinerUp">Get up</action>
			</entity>
		sits in the far corner.</p>
	</require>

	<actionText name="papers">
		Going over to the desk, you flip through several sheets of paper. One
		contains your grocery shopping list. Another is your most recent
		electricity bill. There is a collection of random doodles on the final
		collection of pages.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="drawer">
		The desk drawer is filled with office supplies. Several pencils and
		pens are in a white plastic container. The hole puncher and the stapler
		are lined up beside them.
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="reclinerSit">
		You sit down in the chair. It is a fluffy, well-loved seat. You trace
		the subtle, velvety pattern woven into the fabric with your fingertip.	
	</actionText>

	<actionText name="reclinerUp">
		You push the handle on the side down and the footrest folds back into
		the recliner. Rising, you stretch until you hear a pop in your back. It
		feels good.
	</actionText>
</scene>

<scene id="insideDeath">
	<p>Pressure builds inside the room. Frightened, you flee to the nearby
	closet for extra protection and duck down on your knees. There is a
	terrible wrenching sound as the winds tear at your home. Wood cracks and
	splinters, flying through the air around you. One of the walls of the
	closet collapses. You try to scoot away and use a jacket as a shield, but
	plaster hits you on the head. As your eyes slowly close, you see the
	tornado nearing your hiding place. Then, everything fades away.</p>
</scene>

<scene id="outsideDeath">
	<p>The wind has grown terrible in the time you’ve spent outside. It is
	difficult to move around. Looking up, you notice a funnel cloud spinning
	quickly behind the tree grove. You turn to find protection, but the tornado
	is moving too quickly. You stumble, loose your footing, and realize you are
	no longer on the ground. Trying to breathe, you are flung through the air
	in speeds you have never experienced before. The force hurts. Darkness
	creeps across your vision as you are carried far away.</p>	
</scene>

<scene id="shelterDeath">
	<p>Wind forces the shelter door open before you can yank it shut. Debris
	flies through the air so you quickly retreat back against the metal wall.
	There is an awful ripping sound all around you. As you look up at the
	entrance, a tree strikes the storm shelter and causes the walls around the
	door to buckle. The wind whips around the tree, shifting it. A branch
	suddenly juts into the room as the tree is shifted by the tornado. The limb
	strikes you in the stomach. You topple backwards and touch your stomach.
	When you remove your hand it is covered in scarlet. Your surroundings begin
	to fade away as your mind is numbed by pain.</p>
