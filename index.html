	door to buckle. The wind whips around the tree, shifting it. A branch
	suddenly juts into the room as the tree is shifted by the tornado. The limb
	strikes you in the stomach. You topple backwards and touch your stomach.

<scene id="inOfficeLife">
	<p>A shockwave ripples through the office. You collide with the wall, but
	manage to stay upright. The glass wall shatters as another tremor strikes
	the building. Managing to avoid the falling glass, you scamper down the
	hallway. The floor suddenly buckles, tossing you to the ground. You look up
	as a heavy filing cabinet tips forward. You throw your arms up to protect
	your face from the inevitable impact, but nothing happens. You look up. A
	stranger has his back against the cabinet, preventing it from falling on
	you.</p>

	<p>"I will protect you," the stranger tells you.</p>

	<p>The man gives you a warm, inviting smile and extends his hand to you.
	You gape at the outstretched hand while your heart thunders in your
	chest.</p>

	<p><entity>All is still.

<scene id="outsideOfficeLife">
	<p>The land ruptures and convulses as you stumble behind the bench.
	Coughing and gasping in the dusty air, you finally see the trees and duck
	behind them for protection. Something that sounds like an avalanche rends
	the air.  Frantically, you look around and see that the nearby hill is
	rolling forward. You begin sprinting, but the crusty mound is faster than
	you.  Soon, a shadow passes over your head. You trip and are sent sprawling
	on the asphalt. Looking back, you see the ground tower above you. You also
	notice a figure step between you and the oncoming landslide.</p>

	<p>"Trust me," the stranger tells you as he notices the fear flood your eyes.</p>

	<p>The man raises his arms. The land not only stops but retreats to where it
	came from originally. Your body tingles, but these new feelings do not
	arise from the earthquake. The man turns and looks directly into your eyes.</p>
