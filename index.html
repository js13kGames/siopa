	<p>The door creaks as you twist the metal handle. It has been a long time

<scene id="insideDeath">
	<p>Pressure builds inside the room. Frightened, you flee to the nearby

	terrible wrenching sound as the winds tear at your home. Wood cracks and
	splinters, flying through the air around you. One of the walls of the
	closet collapses. You try to scoot away and use a jacket as a shield, but
	plaster hits you on the head. As your eyes slowly close, you see the

	quickly behind the tree grove. You turn to find protection, but the tornado
	is moving too quickly. You stumble, loose your footing, and realize you are
	no longer on the ground. Trying to breathe, you are flung through the air
	in speeds you have never experienced before. The force hurts. Darkness

	<p>Wind forces the shelter door open before you can yank it shut. Debris
	flies through the air so you quickly retreat back against the metal wall.
	There is an awful ripping sound all around you. As you look up at the
	entrance, a tree strikes the storm shelter and causes the walls around the
	door to buckle. The wind whips around the tree, shifting it. A branch
	suddenly juts into the room as the tree is shifted by the tornado. The limb
	strikes you in the stomach. You topple backwards and touch your stomach.
	When you remove your hand it is covered in scarlet. Your surroundings begin

	<p>Surprised and shocked, your jaw drops open as he takes your hand and leads
	you outside. The intense winds rip at your clothing as the tornado gets
	closer to your house. You are about to shout over the cyclone when the man

	<p>"All will be well," he simply says. He points at the tornado.</p>

	<p>Turning, you look across the lawn just as the cyclone spirals above the

	standing there. There is a sickening ripping sound as something is torn out
	of the ground. As you watch, the man raises his arms and he catches the
	trunk of a full-grown tree. He gingerly sets it down.</p>

	<p>"Come out," he tells you.</p>

	<p>Obeying his words, you climb the storm shelter steps and go outside. The

	<p>A compassionate smile lights up his features as he asks you, "Have you so little faith?"</p>

	<p>Unable to respond to his question, you merely gawk at him as he walks
	unperturbedly toward the front of the boat. He raises his arms and the

<scene id="branchDeath">
	<p>Flames leap and hiss between the trees. You look around as the forest
	blazes in crimson, scarlet, goldenrod, and ochre hues. The air shimmers and
	waves in the intense heat. Just as your mind comprehends your dire
	situation, you hear a terrible pop and crack. Looking up, you have just

	<p>You begin to feel dizzy as you look around the campsite. The air buckles
	and dances like a mirage. It feels like you are standing in a furnace.
	Something black and gray drifts across your vision as you collapse to your
	knees. Slowly, you realize it is ash flying through the smoke-filled air.
	Your lungs start to constrict. Coughing, you beat the ground with your
	curled fists. Looking up one last time, you see orange tongues lick the
	forest around your campsite. Your vision becomes hazy. Then, your eyes

	<p>A tree splits as you look up. The entire forest behind your tent is
	engulfed in flames. Quickly, you hit the gas. The jeep leaps forward. You
	are jostled about as you floor the pedal, knuckles ashen as you cling to
	the steering wheel. Fire quickly jumps from tree to tree around your jeep.
	A flame reaches forward and consumes the back of your vehicle. The sounds
	of an awful explosion reach your mind as fire races down the inside of your
	vehicle. A piece of sharp shrapnel slices the side of your neck just before
	the heat forces its way out of your windshield. The entire jeep ruptures

<scene id="branchLife">
	<p>There is a cackling, spitting sound above you. Looking up, you see the tree
	is fully ablaze and beginning to split apart. The tree trembles and then
	groans, sending a spray of sparks into the air as half of the trunk falls
	toward you. As you stare, rooted to the spot, you feel yourself tip
	backwards. To your surprise, you are looking up into the face of a complete
	stranger. Slowly, you realize he has just saved you from the fallen limb.</p>

	<p>"You are safe now."</p>

	<p>Protected by this stranger, you cannot help but believe that if you stay

<scene id="smokeLife">
	<p>The entire forest is alight around your campsite. You turn from side to

	Coughing, you cover your mouth. Your eyes itch and become watery. Giving
	the woods one final scan, you see a figure standing between the trees,
	surrounded by the flames.</p>

	<p>"Come to me," he says, beckoning to you with his arm.</p>

	<p>You hesitate as you notice the flames around him, but then cough and wheeze
	again. Running, you leap over the wildfire and join the stranger. As you
	stand beside him, you notice the forest is no longer ablaze. Instead, your
	heart begins to burn as you gaze at the man.</p>

<scene id="jeepLife">
	<p>As you drive quickly through the blazing forest, you glance in your
	rearview mirror. The fire is quickly catching up to your jeep despite the
	rapid pace. After a moment, you also realize you see something else behind
	you. A stranger sits in the backseat and watches you. Your mouth goes dry
	as you try to think of a reason to reassure your unknown passenger that
	everything will be fine, but nothing comes to mind.</p>

	<p>"Trust me to drive," the man suddenly tells you.</p>

	<p>Assured by his calm tone, you break the jeep and let him have the
	driver’s seat. As the jeep sets off again, you realize he is driving
	patiently through the woods. The fire soon surrounds the vehicle and heats
	the air like a furnace. Flames spit and hiss, but they do not touch the
	jeep. You arrive safely at the base of the mountain and look with wonder at
	the driver.</p>

	rolling forward. You begin sprinting, but the crusty mound is faster than
